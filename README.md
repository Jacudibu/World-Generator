# World-Generator Scripts
A small collection of C# Scripts that can be used for World Generation.
Unity is used for visualization, so the scripts in the WorldGeneration folder should be pretty easy to extract and use somewhere else if needed.

## Implemented Algorithms
* Diamond-Square
* Cell Noise
